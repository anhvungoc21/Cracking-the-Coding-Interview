## Prompt
There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. 
You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. 
Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?

## Answer
For each row we fill, the next row will always have 7 squares left because one domino is sticking out into that row.

Or, show that there are usually 32 white and 32 black squares in a normal chess board. By blocking out two opposite corners,
we have 32 white and 30 black squares left (or the reverse). Since each domino takes up 1 white and 1 black squares, 31 dominos will fill 31 white and 31 black squares. It is therefore impossible.
