## Prompt:
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

## Answer:
### Observations:
- To measure 4 quarts, the water must be stored in the 5-quart jug
- We can get 2 quarts initially by doing (5 - 3).
- Once we have 2 quarts in a jug, we don't get any info from the 5-quart jug, but we have a 1-quart gap in the 3-quart jug.
- 4 quarts is 5-1. We have found a way!

### Solution:
- Get 2 quarts in the 5-quart jug by filling it, then pour into the 3-quart jug. Dump the 3-quart jug.
- Pour the 2 quarts into the 3-quart jug.
- Fill the 5-quart jug. Pour it into the 3-quart jug until the 3-quart jug is full.
=> There is now 4 quarts in the 5-quart jug.
