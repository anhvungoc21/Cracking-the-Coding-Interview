# Cracking the Coding Interview
This repository contains my solutions to problems in CTCI. Aside from the code solutions, I also keep a record of my thought processes, observations, assumptions, and errors I made in the process. Just a personal archive that might help people who come across understand how I go about solving technical problems!
